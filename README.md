An assistive communications program designed for use with an EMG sensor. Can be used without EMG sensor with clicks. Built in matlab Appdesigner.  User controls a grid selection process by tensing a muscle to make a needle on a guage rise. If needle reaches threshold then program registers a selection.  The public "ReadEMG" function can be edited to use with other sensors.
